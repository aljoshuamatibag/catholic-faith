					Padre Pio, also known as Saint Pius of Pietrelcina (Italian: Pio da
					Pietrelcina; 25 May 1887 – 23 September 1968), was an Italian
					Franciscan Capuchin, friar, priest, stigmatist, and mystic, now
					venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church. Born Francesco Forgione,
					he was given the name of Pius (Italian: Pio) when he joined the Order
					of Friars Minor Capuchin. Padre Pio became famous for exhibiting
					stigmata for most of his life, thereby generating much interest and
					controversy. He was both beatified (1999) and canonized (2002) by Pope
					John Paul II. The Sanctuary of Saint Pio of Pietrelcina is located in
					San Giovanni Rotondo, Province of Foggia, Italy.

					Francis of Assisi (born Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone; Italian:
					Francesco d'Assisi; Latin: Franciscus Assisiensis; 1181 or 1182 – 3
					October 1226), venerated as Saint Francis of Assisi, also known in his
					ministry as Francesco, was an Italian Catholic friar, deacon, mystic,
					and preacher.[3] He founded the men's Order of Friars Minor, the
					women's Order of St. Clare, the Third Order of St. Francis and the
					Custody of the Holy Land. Francis is one of the most venerated
					religious figures in Christianity.[1] Pope Gregory IX canonized
					Francis on 16 July 1228. Along with Catherine of Siena, he was
					designated patron saint of Italy. He later became associated with
					patronage of animals and the natural environment, and it became
					customary for churches to hold ceremonies blessing animals on or near
					his feast day of 4 October. In 1219, he went to Egypt in an attempt to
					convert the sultan al-Kamil to put an end to the conflict of the Fifth
					Crusade.[4] By this point, the Franciscan Order had grown to such an
					extent that its primitive organizational structure was no longer
					sufficient. He returned to Italy to organize the order. Once his
					community was authorized by the Pope, he withdrew increasingly from
					external affairs. Francis is known for his love of the Eucharist.[5]
					In 1223, Francis arranged for the first Christmas live nativity
					scene.[a][6][7] According to Christian tradition, in 1224 he received
					the stigmata during the apparition of a Seraphic angel in a religious
					ecstasy[8] which would make him the first person in Christian
					tradition to bear the wounds of Christ's Passion.[9] He died during
					the evening hours of 3 October 1226, while listening to a reading he
					had requested of Psalm 142 (141).
