				Francis of Assisi (born Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone; Italian:
				Francesco d'Assisi; Latin: Franciscus Assisiensis; 1181 or 1182 – 3
				October 1226), venerated as Saint Francis of Assisi, also known in his
				ministry as Francesco, was an Italian Catholic friar, deacon, mystic,
				and preacher.[3] He founded the men's Order of Friars Minor, the
				women's Order of St. Clare, the Third Order of St. Francis and the
				Custody of the Holy Land. Francis is one of the most venerated
				religious figures in Christianity.[1] Pope Gregory IX canonized
				Francis on 16 July 1228. Along with Catherine of Siena, he was
				designated patron saint of Italy. He later became associated with
				patronage of animals and the natural environment, and it became
				customary for churches to hold ceremonies blessing animals on or near
				his feast day of 4 October. In 1219, he went to Egypt in an attempt to
				convert the sultan al-Kamil to put an end to the conflict of the Fifth
				Crusade.[4] By this point, the Franciscan Order had grown to such an
				extent that its primitive organizational structure was no longer
				sufficient. He returned to Italy to organize the order. Once his
				community was authorized by the Pope, he withdrew increasingly from
				external affairs. Francis is known for his love of the Eucharist.[5]
				In 1223, Francis arranged for the first Christmas live nativity
				scene.[a][6][7] According to Christian tradition, in 1224 he received
				the stigmata during the apparition of a Seraphic angel in a religious
				ecstasy[8] which would make him the first person in Christian
				tradition to bear the wounds of Christ's Passion.[9] He died during
				the evening hours of 3 October 1226, while listening to a reading he
				had requested of Psalm 142 (141). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi"

				priest and friar of the Franciscan Order. He was born and raised by a wealthy family in Lisbon,
				Portugal, and died in Padua, Italy. Noted by his contemporaries for his powerful preaching, expert
				knowledge of scripture, and undying love and devotion to the poor and the sick, he was one of the most
				quickly canonized saints in church history, being canonized less than a year after his death. He was
				proclaimed a Doctor of the Church by Pope Pius XII on 16 January 1946. <a href="

			<h3>Thomas of Aquinas</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container d-flex justify-content-start m-sm-5">
			<p>
				Thomas Aquinas, OP (/əˈkwaɪnəs/; Italian: Tommaso d'Aquino, lit. 'Thomas of Aquino'; 1225 – 7 March
				1274) was an Italian Dominican friar and priest, who was an immensely influential philosopher,
				theologian, and jurist in the tradition of scholasticism; he is known within the scholastic tradition as
				the Doctor Angelicus, the Doctor Communis, and the Doctor Universalis. The name Aquinas identifies
				his ancestral origins in the county of Aquino in present-day Lazio, Italy. Among other things, he was a
				prominent proponent of natural theology and the father of a school of thought (encompassing both
				theology and philosophy) known as Thomism. He argued that God is the source of both the light of natural
				reason and the light of faith. He has been described as "the most influential thinker of the
				medieval period" and "the greatest of the medieval philosopher-theologians." His influence on
				Western thought is considerable, and much of modern philosophy is derived from his ideas, particularly
				in the areas of ethics, natural law, metaphysics, and political theory.

				Unlike many currents in the Catholic Church of the time, Thomas embraced several ideas put forward
				by Aristotle — whom he called "the Philosopher" — and attempted to synthesize Aristotelian philosophy
				with the principles of Christianity.

				His best-known works are the Disputed Questions on Truth (1256–1259), the Summa contra Gentiles
				(1259–1265), and the unfinished but massively influential Summa Theologica, or Summa Theologiae
				(1265–1274). His commentaries on Scripture and on Aristotle also form an important part of his body of
				work. Furthermore, Thomas is distinguished for his eucharistic hymns, which form a part of the church's
				liturgy. The Catholic Church honors Thomas Aquinas as a saint and regards him as the model teacher
				for those studying for the priesthood, and indeed the highest expression of both natural reason and
				speculative theology. In modern times, under papal directives, the study of his works was long used as a
				core of the required program of study for those seeking ordination as priests or deacons, as well as for
				those in religious formation and for other students of the sacred disciplines (philosophy, Catholic
				theology, church history, liturgy, and canon law).

				As a Doctor of the Church, Thomas Aquinas is considered one of the Catholic Church's greatest
				theologians and philosophers. Pope Benedict XV declared: "This (Dominican) Order ... acquired new luster
				when the Church declared the teaching of Thomas to be her own and that Doctor, honored with the special
				praises of the Pontiffs, the master and patron of Catholic schools." <a

				venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church. Born Francesco Forgione,
				he was given the name of Pius (Italian: Pio) when he joined the Order
				of Friars Minor Capuchin. Padre Pio became famous for exhibiting
				stigmata for most of his life, thereby generating much interest and

				Maximilian Maria Kolbe (born Raymund Kolbe; Polish: Maksymilian Maria Kolbe [maksɨˌmʲilʲan ˌmarʲja
				ˈkɔlbɛ]; 8 January 1894 – 14 August 1941), venerated as Saint Maximilian Kolbe, was a Polish Catholic
				priest and Conventual Franciscan friar who volunteered to die in place of a man named Franciszek
				Gajowniczek in the German death camp of Auschwitz, located in German-occupied Poland during World War
				II. He had been active in promoting the veneration of the Immaculate Virgin Mary, founding and
				supervising the monastery of Niepokalanów near Warsaw, operating an amateur-radio station (SP3RN), and
				founding or running several other organizations and publications.

				On 10 October 1982, Pope John Paul II canonized Kolbe and declared him a martyr of charity. The
				Catholic Church venerates him as the patron saint of amateur radio operators, drug addicts, political
				prisoners, families, journalists, and prisoners. John Paul II declared him "The Patron Saint of Our
				Difficult Century." His feast day is 14 August, the day of his death.

				Due to Kolbe's efforts to promote consecration and entrustment to Mary, he is known as the Apostle of
				Consecration to Mary. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_Kolbe" target="_blank">Read

			<h3>Josemaría Escrivá</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container d-flex justify-content-start m-sm-5">
			<p>
				Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer y Albás (9 January 1902 – 26 June 1975) was a Spanish Roman Catholic
				priest. He founded Opus Dei, an organization of laypeople and priests dedicated to the teaching that
				everyone is called to holiness by God and that ordinary life can result in sanctity. He was canonized in
				2002 by Pope John Paul II, who declared Josemaría should be "counted among the great witnesses of
				Christianity."

				Escrivá gained a doctorate in civil law at the Complutense University of Madrid and a doctorate in
				theology at the Lateran University in Rome. His principal work was the initiation, government and
				expansion of Opus Dei. Escrivá's best-known publication is The Way, which has been translated into 43
				languages and has sold several million copies.

				Escrivá and Opus Dei have been accused of secrecy, elitism, cult-like practices, and involvement with
				right-wing causes, such as the rule of Francisco Franco in Spain (1939–1975). After his death, his
				canonization attracted considerable attention and controversy among some Catholics and the worldwide
				press. Several journalists who have investigated the history of Opus Dei, among them Vatican analyst
				John L. Allen Jr., have argued that many of these accusations are unproven or have grown from
				allegations by enemies of Escrivá and his organization. Cardinal Albino Luciani (later Pope
				John Paul I), John Paul II, Benedict XVI, Pope Francis, Óscar Romero, and many other Catholic leaders
				have endorsed Escrivá's teaching concerning the universal call to holiness, the role of the laity, and
				the sanctifying effect of ordinary work. According to Allen, among Catholics, Escrivá is "reviled by
				some and venerated by millions more."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josemaría_Escrivá"
